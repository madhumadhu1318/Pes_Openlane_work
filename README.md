<summary>DAY 2 : Good floorplan vs bad floorplan and introduction to library cells </summary>
<br>


# GOOD FLOORPLAN VS BAD FLORPLAN AND INTRODUCTION TO LIBRARY CELLS

## 1) CHIP FLOOR PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS

## L1) Utilization Factor and Aspect ratio

  ![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/3aef58ab-6ea3-4aec-9ea3-a1c5ed63b771)

    - Defining the width and height of the core and Die
    - Consider a netlist with 2 FF and 2 gates with the connections shown below


**STEP-1** Make the gates as a Squared box 

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/4f09822c-6af6-42c8-a712-5ae75beed286)


**STEP-2** Find out the dimensions of the core and Die ( Dimensions of the standard cells )

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/3e2a0161-d1df-470b-a65f-0163083508ad)


 #### For example 
  - Let us assume that each FF and Gates is on 1 cm breadth and 1cm height
  - Now Area of each standard cell will be will of 1 cm sq .
  - Allining tha area ocuupied the netlist in a in a single core .
  - Below the netlist will be fit into the core So it will be **100% utilization**
  - **Utilization factor** = Area occupied by the netlist / Total area ocuupied by the core.
  - where 4sq / 4sq = 1 . 
  - In this case when utilization factor = 1 , then the core is full no extra components can be added.
  - **Aspect ratoio** = Height / width , if it is 1 , it signifies that the core is square shaped.




## L2) Pre placed cells

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/a005bcbc-a546-4648-b8a5-0e23ad8c1944)

  - Conisder a combinational block -> Gate level diagram.
  - Seperate that gate level diagram into two blocks.
  - Consider the multiple blocks are inside a Black box Now seperate the blackbox as two differnet IP's or Modules .
  - The Arrangements of the IP's in a chip is called as **Floor planning**.
  - The IP's will have an user defined loctions and they can be placed in a chip before the placement and rouiting is done hence these are calle as **Pre placed Cells**




## L3) Decoupling Capacitors

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/1892d647-2b21-4e6a-8030-66ce9364f7cc)

  - For any signal to be considered as a Logic 0 and Logic 1, It should be within the NM range ( Either NML or NMH )
  - The area between the NML and NMH is called undefined area
  - So in order to maintain the signal to be in the NML or NMh **Decoupling capacitors** are used.
  - Decoupling capacitors are mainly used to maintain the signal are not inside the undefined area.
    



## L4) Power Planning

![Screenshot from 2023-09-14 12-58-34](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/ff16ed45-9495-49a6-b260-d3d194323738)

  - Insted of using individual VDD and VSS for multiple cells in a Block.
  - Suppose if there are four cells in a Block , Each cell having seperate VDD and VSS are called as **Power Planning**




## L5) Pin placement and Logical cell placement Blockage

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/71f697d9-472c-4e79-a502-2f7001500a86)

  - Here consider a 4 set of circuts with input, clk and output,
  - Considering all 4 circuits together and placing on a chip in such a way that INPUTS should be at one side and OUTPUT should be at one side which helps us to make the connections easily.
  - So this process is called as **Pin placement**
  - Making sure that non of the automated routing tool should not be placed near the i/p and o/p cells it needs to block the cells This is called as **Logical cell placement Blockage**
    

**Pin Placement**

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/e9a4597c-0d8b-4c75-a8a2-051b0ecb81c7)


**Logical cell placement Blockage**

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/cf98ef58-1fb1-4de8-9767-064c70428a9c)





## L6) Steps to run Flopor planning using Openlane

      - These are the defalt Floorplans 
 
 ![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/490bb702-b125-4a02-8b91-f3b190a4580b)


 ![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/7d421dc9-ea0c-4250-ae6f-2d8598717d3b)


 ![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/e080bb6a-bb17-4001-a3f2-0774536b20b4)


## L7)

              - In the openlane shell

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/382fb424-a1f7-46a5-981d-bf0aef5ba065)
              
              - To open the Floorplan we go to the required directory that is
                   > vsduser@vsdsquadron:~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/11-09_15-36/results/floorplan
              - Using the ```cd``` command.
              - Then we type the command:
                   > magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def &

              - The following layout is displayed

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/6622214d-dac3-4cd8-b8d2-f3f30c095247)

              - We can press 's' and then 'v' to align the design to the center of the screen.

              - We can right click on the mouse and pess 'z' to zoom into a desired part.

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/8fb90206-cd3c-4177-9936-09885389bc84)

              - We can check the details of the ports as follows
              - Hover over a port with your crosshair and press 's' on your keyboard
              - Now open the tkcon command window and type ```what```.
              - This will show you the details of the selected port.

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/fbb5a5da-ce91-41fa-a23b-21eda8b68d5c)
             
              - If we zoom in a little more, we can see the tap cells.
              - They are present to prevent latch up conditions which occur in the CMOS devices

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/540cc442-61e7-41f9-8075-276feb7f048f)

              - These are the standard cells that are used in the design




## 2) LIBRARY BINDING AND PLACEMENTS


### L1) Netlist binding and initial Place Design

       - Bind netlist with physical cells 
       - Here it defines about the shape and sixe of the standard cell
       - Each cells are defined only in either rectange shape or square shape 
       - In this example, 1 refers to NOT gate, 2 refers to AND gate.   [image 1]
       - Larger the cell size 
          > It has a least resistance path
          > Performes Faster
       - Once we have a Physical veiw of all cells, It is placed on the Floorplan according to the Netlist.  [image 2]

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/42d823d6-4c27-4631-805e-7d8d972ab95a)


![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/f7ff1136-48b7-4e0f-81ea-6a4cbeba3222)



### L2 and L3) Optimize placement using estimate wire length and capacitance

        - When the cells are not extactly placed on the floorplan as in the netlist, If the relevant cells are not near to i/p or o/p.
        - Then estimation of wirelength and capacitance comes in.
        - Depending on the Capacitance and how far the cells are from input and output, Some **Buffers** are added in order to reduce the Wirelength and also to get a complete signal without any             lossses of signal ( but in cost of Area which can be minimized later )
    
          
![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/59d2d9da-75ca-4615-88e4-f0c0c9878509)


![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/efe1ae28-f0bd-4df2-aec4-b2316b7e3857)



### L4) Need for libraries and characterization 

        - Library characterization and modelling depends on some steps,
        - Logic synthesis  ->  Floor planning  ->  Placement  ->  Clock Tree synthesuis ( CTS )  ->  Routing 
        - The collection of all the standard cells are placed is one area which is referred as **Library**

        
![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/2c0629b1-a07e-45d8-a58a-3e865f7ff28f)



### L5) Congestion aware placement using replace
          - To view the placement we type
                   > run_placement
          - In the OpenLANE shell.

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/18162a42-f288-4007-baba-6f759a9a6184)

          - This is the result displayed. As we can see the '/picorv32a.placement.def' file is read.

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/5c9dc6ed-fc8e-4f8f-80c8-922a4f749991)

          - We move one directory up from the 'floorplan' folder using
                   > cd ../placement/

          - To view the placement design we use the command
                   > magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.placement.def

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/a2807440-c80b-43c3-967d-e2c113fb44a4)

          - The above is displayed.
          - All these standard cells were present at the initial layout of the floorplan.

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/c4f005a1-0ac8-4693-bf09-d920692c4f09)

          - If we zoom in we can see the placement of the standard cells in the standard cell rows.




## 3) CELL DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZATION FLOW

### L1) Inputs for cell Design Flow
       - For each standard cell (AND,NOR,INVERTER,FF ect) There are different cell design flow
       - Each Cell Design Flow consists of 3 steps:
               - Inputs ( which mainly consists of PDK's [ DRC and LVs rules, Spice models, library ect] )
               - Design Steps (this mainly invovles 3 steps)
                      - Circuit Design
                      - Layout Design 
                      - Charecterization
               - Outputs ( Outputs we get here is  CDL circuit description language )
               
   #### User defined specifications
       - Cell height = The seperation between the power rail and ground rail defines the cell height.
       - Supply voltage = A certain cell should be operated at a certain supply voltage which is defined by the Top level design
       - Metal Layer = Certain Libraries van be designed on a particular Metal Layer.
       - Pin Location = Library nedds to decide on the pins and the pin location where it needs to be placed.

               
### L2) Circuit Design step
      - There are teo steps involved in circuit design:
            > Implement the Function itself
            > Modelling the PMOS and NMOS transisters in such a way that the aspect ratio should be matched.
            
      
### L3) Layout Design step
      - Implimenting the PMOS and NMOS values into layout are called Layout Design 
      - Steps involved in the layout design are:
           - Get the function implimented through the MOS transistors
           - Get a PMOS network graph and NMOS network graph
           - Obtain Euler's Path and draw a Stick Diagram
           - Convert the stick diagram into a proper Layout diagram
           - EXtract the paracetics from the layout and CHaracterize it interms of Timmings.

           
### L4) Typical Charaterization Flow
     - Steps involved in the characteriztion flow are :
           - Read in the Model Files
           - Read the extracted spice netlist

### L2) Propogation delay and transition time

**Propagation Delay**
The time difference between when the transitional input reaches 50% of its final value and when the output reaches 50% of its final value.
     
     - There should be no negative delay in the charecterization, This can be taken care by setting a proper threshold point.

```
    Propagation delay = time(out_fall_thr)-time(in_rise_thr)

```

**Transition Time**
The time it takes the signal to move between states is the transition time , where the time is measured between 10% and 90% or 20% to 80% of the signal levels.

```
Rise transition time = time(slew_high_rise_thr) - time (slew_low_rise_thr)
```

```
Fall transition time = time(slew_high_fall_thr) - time (slew_low_fall_thr)
```

                     - Step2 -> Mask1 the region (protecting)
                     - Step3 -> So the UV rays doesnt hit the photoresist layer which is under Mask.
                     - Step4 -> Silicon layer is etched off in the Non masking region.
                     - Step5 -> Remove the Photoresist
                     - Step6 -> Placed in an oxidation furnance
                     - Step7 -> Isolation area will be created This process is called as LOCUS.

### L4) Ligtly dopped drain (LDD) formation
                   - Lightly doped drain (LDD) formation involves implanting the drain and source regions of a MOSFET transistor with a lighter concentration of dopants to reduce hot 
                     electron effect and short channel effect and enhance device performance.
                   - Doing both  n+ impantation and p+ implantation.
                   - It involves plasma etching here

### L5) Source and drain formation
                  - Source and drain formation in a MOSFET transistor typically involves doping the silicon substrate with chemicals such as arsenic or phosphorous for n-type regions 
                  (source and drain) and boron for p-type regions (source and drain).
                  - Here the source and drain are done by using ARSENIC method
                  - High temperature annealing is performed.

### L8) Lab introduction to Sky130 basic layers layout and LEF using inverter

                - Now let us look at the layout of a CMOS inverter. To open this we type the command

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/ffaeccd3-bc9d-4169-a71c-bd49ac46d11f)

                - Now run the command 
                     > magic -T sky130A.tech sky130_inv.mag &
                - The following layout will be displayed.

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/ff9195c0-7445-4f75-bf56-0e9d3567196d)


                - We can get to know the details of the inverter by hovering the mouse cursor over it and pressing 's' on the keyboard. 
                - Then we can type what in the tkcon. 
                - Pressing 's' three times will show what parts are connected to the selected part.
                - We shall look at the difference between LEF and Layout. The above image is a Layout.
                - LEF represents abstract component data in a machine-readable format for IC libraries, while layout is the physical geometric arrangement 
                  of these components on a semiconductor chip.


                 
### L9) Lab steps to create std cell layout and extract spice netlist

                - DRC error can be veiwed on the tkcon
                - To extract Spice Netlist we perform the following steps in the tkcon window:


![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/93bac30d-c8a1-4445-afed-ffe79c083150)



                - We use the commands
                       > ext2spice cthresh 0 rthresh 0 -> this is done to copy the parasitic capacitances
                - The next command is
                       > ext2spice
                - We can see that a sky130_inv.spice file will be created


![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/72bccd1d-53f6-4576-9d5e-1495bd6b2173)


## 3) SKY130 TECH FILE LABS

               - To start off we look at the minimum value of the layout window

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/3348cb27-20ec-41cd-8cb7-6ca935e4cf47)


               -  We can use 'g' on the keyboard to activate the grid and after selecting a grid by right clicking on the mouse, we type box in tkcon window to check the 
                  minimum value of the layout window


![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/e51c812f-17b3-4aec-9494-a7ca47789b0b)

### L2) Lab steps to characterize inverter using sky130 model files
               - Next we need to open the spice file using the command
                        > gedit sky130_inv.spice
               - We need to configure it to the above specifications.
               - Characterize Inverter using Sky130 Models
               
![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/47956882-ed55-49c0-b44d-c74b9b35bd90)

               - We now plot the graph for output vs input sweeping the time.
               - We first use the command
                        > ngspice sky130_inv.spice
               - In the ngspice shell we use the command
                        > plot y vs time a
               - The following graph will be displayed

## 1) TIMMING MODELLING USING DELAY TABLES

### Lab challenge to find missing or incorrect rules and fix them

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/7caa9c46-1f7b-4c44-a849-d023b7d3dba9)

       - Converting grid info into Track info
       - Go to openlane directory / sky130_fd_sc_hd 
       - type less tracks.info

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/b5bde9d6-5d95-4452-aec7-138935f5cefb)

        - From the above pic, its confirmed that the pins A and Y are at the intersection of X and Y tracks. So the first condition is met.
        - The PR boundary is taking 3 grids on width and 9 grids on height which says that the 2nd condition is also met



## GENERATION OF A LEF FILE
        - Once the layout is perfect we can generate the lef file
        - In the tkcon window type the following command to save the updated layout
              > save sky130_vsdinv.mag
        - once it is saved then go to the terminal window and the type 
              > magic -T sky130A.Tech sky130_vsdinv.mag &
        - A magic layout opens , In the tkcon window type 
              > lef write

        - Now if u check in the picorv terminal, the lef file will be copied 

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/37de186e-57d2-4d89-a027-99fc34d1544e)

        - Modify the config.tcl by
             > vim config.tcl
        - In the design's config.tcl file add the below line to point to the lef location which is required during spice extraction.
               > set ::env(EXTRA_LEFS) [glob $::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/$::env(DESIGN_NAME)/src/*.lef]
        - Include the below command to include the additional lef into the flow:
               > set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
               > add_lefs -src $lefs
        - Run the interactive mode

## TIMMING ANALYSIS WITH REAL CLOCKS USING OPEN STA

         - Configure OpenSTA for Post-Synth Timing Analysis
         - We must create two files
              - The first one must be in the openlane directory
              - This file is known as the 'pre_sta.conf' file.

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/aeec25c6-c897-4218-be0b-62a048c76a54)

              - The second is the my_base.sdc file.
              - This should be in the 'src/sky130' directory under the picorv32a directory.
             
![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/d73a4a04-6bbf-4010-b7f2-8c3427dd0b12)

              - To run tyming analysis we type 
                    > sta pre_sta.conf

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/ac22c1af-3022-4ad5-b5b8-e4427e1bc888)

             - There is a slack violation
             - Settinf MAX_FANOUT value to 4 reduces the slack violation.

## Clock Tree Synthesis TritonCTS and Signal Integrity
### Run CTS

             -  To run CTS we need to type the command
                       > run_cts
                       > New .v is created

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/b1f93411-14b4-4f47-b523-4c1d7eb71913)

<summary>DAY 5 : Final steps for RTL2GDS using triton route and openSTA </summary>
<br>

## Power Distribution Network and Routing

After generating our clock tree network and verifying post routing STA checks we are ready to generate the power distribution network gen_pdn in OpenLANE:

     The PDN feature within OpenLANE will create:

          Power ring global to the entire core
          Power halo local to any preplaced cells
          Power straps to bring power into the center of the chip
          Power rails for the standard cells

   ### Build Power Distribution network
   
![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/5d1ea9af-11c2-4200-8fb4-ac7850ffa1dd)


![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/1f2915be-f8fc-4fb4-a192-3e2c30afa917)


   ### Global and Detailed Routing

   - OpenLANE uses TritonRoute as the routing engine run_routing for physical implementations of designs. Routing consists of two stages:
           > Global Routing - Routing guides are generated for interconnects on our netlist defining what layers, and where on the chip each of the nets will be reputed
           > Detailed Routing - Metal traces are iteratively laid across the routing guides to physically implement the routing guides

   - If DRC errors persist after routing the user has two options:
           > Re-run routing with higher QoR settings
           > Manually fix DRC errors specific in tritonRoute.drc file

  ### SPEF Extraction

    - After routing has been completed interconnect parasitics can be extracted to perform sign-off post-route STA analysis. The parasitics are extracted into a SPEF file. The SPEF extractor 
      is not included within OpenLANE as of now.
           > cd ~/Desktop/work/tools/SPEFEXTRACTOR
           > python3 main.py <path to merged.lef in tmp> <path to def in routing>
    - The SPEF File will be generated in the location where def file is present
