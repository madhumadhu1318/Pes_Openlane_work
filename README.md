# OPENLANE 

## ABOUT THE REPOSITORY
OpenLane is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, SPEF-Extractor, KLayout and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization. The flow performs all ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII.

You can check out the documentation, including in-depth guides and reference manuals at [ReadTheDocs](https://openlane.readthedocs.io/).

<summary>DAY 2 : Good floorplan vs bad floorplan and introduction to library cells </summary>

# GOOD FLOORPLAN VS BAD FLORPLAN AND INTRODUCTION TO LIBRARY CELLS

## 1) CHIP FLOOR PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS

## L1) Utilization Factor and Aspect ratio

  ![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/3aef58ab-6ea3-4aec-9ea3-a1c5ed63b771)

    - Defining the width and height of the core and Die
    - Consider a netlist with 2 FF and 2 gates with the connections shown below


**STEP-1** Make the gates as a Squared box 

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/4f09822c-6af6-42c8-a712-5ae75beed286)


**STEP-2** Find out the dimensions of the core and Die ( Dimensions of the standard cells )

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/3e2a0161-d1df-470b-a65f-0163083508ad)


 #### For example 
  - Let us assume that each FF and Gates is on 1 cm breadth and 1cm height
  - Now Area of each standard cell will be will of 1 cm sq .
  - Allining tha area ocuupied the netlist in a in a single core .
  - Below the netlist will be fit into the core So it will be **100% utilization**
  - **Utilization factor** = Area occupied by the netlist / Total area ocuupied by the core.
  - where 4sq / 4sq = 1 . 
  - In this case when utilization factor = 1 , then the core is full no extra components can be added.
  - **Aspect ratoio** = Height / width , if it is 1 , it signifies that the core is square shaped.




## L2) Pre placed cells

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/a005bcbc-a546-4648-b8a5-0e23ad8c1944)

  - Conisder a combinational block -> Gate level diagram.
  - Seperate that gate level diagram into two blocks.
  - Consider the multiple blocks are inside a Black box Now seperate the blackbox as two differnet IP's or Modules .
  - The Arrangements of the IP's in a chip is called as **Floor planning**.
  - The IP's will have an user defined loctions and they can be placed in a chip before the placement and rouiting is done hence these are calle as **Pre placed Cells**




## L3) Decoupling Capacitors

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/1892d647-2b21-4e6a-8030-66ce9364f7cc)

  - For any signal to be considered as a Logic 0 and Logic 1, It should be within the NM range ( Either NML or NMH )
  - The area between the NML and NMH is called undefined area
  - So in order to maintain the signal to be in the NML or NMh **Decoupling capacitors** are used.
  - Decoupling capacitors are mainly used to maintain the signal are not inside the undefined area.
    



## L4) Power Planning

![Screenshot from 2023-09-14 12-58-34](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/ff16ed45-9495-49a6-b260-d3d194323738)

  - Insted of using individual VDD and VSS for multiple cells in a Block.
  - Suppose if there are four cells in a Block , Each cell having seperate VDD and VSS are called as **Power Planning**




## L5) Pin placement and Logical cell placement Blockage

![image](https://github.com/Vinodkumar8318/Pes_Openlane_work/assets/142583979/71f697d9-472c-4e79-a502-2f7001500a86)

  - Here consider a 4 set of circuts with input, clk and output,
  - Considering all 4 circuits together and placing on a chip in such a way that INPUTS should be at one side and OUTPUT should be at one side which helps us to make the connections easily.
  - So this process is called as **Pin placement**
  - Making sure that non of the automated routing tool should not be placed near the i/p and o/p cells it needs to block the cells This is called as **Logical cell placement Blockage**
    

**Pin Placement**

**Logical cell placement Blockage**
